# Angular--Practise
“A structured Angular learning repository documenting my progress with numbered tutorials, hands-on exercises, and well-commented code.”

# Angular Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **step-by-step Angular learning journey**.  
It includes tutorials, exercises, and mini-projects — all with **detailed code comments** for clarity and revision.

## 🔮 Next Steps
- More advanced projects (e-commerce mock, dashboard, authentication)  
- Deployment on **Netlify/Vercel** for showcasing projects  
- Continuous updates as I progress further in Angular 🚀
